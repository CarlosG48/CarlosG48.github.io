### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was a favorite because it introduced me to the variable 'strings' 
    which can hold worlds, unlike integers or doubles. With this, me and my partner
    were able to create a madlibs game that worked on the terminal. It was fun 
    seeing how we can mess around with it and learned how to make our own!

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 is a favorite because it was the first lab that I really did 
    struggle in, but at the same time I found that challenge very fun! This lab
    was the first to introduce conversions and the use of many different types
    of variables. My partner and I definitely had a blast!

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite because it really did show me how much our 
    computers of capable of. I never would have guess that we could write 
    code that would calculate the average of given scores. Gone are the days
    of finding it by hand, you just have to input your numbers in the terminal
    and the machine does it all for you! This lab also introduced the importance 
    of having the right amount of arguments in the terminal.
